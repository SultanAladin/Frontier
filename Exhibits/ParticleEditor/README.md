# Particle editor (C++): evidence

The approved Particle editor prototype (`Experimental/ParticleEditor`) is now in the C++ Frontier editor. It runs the
eos engine (`549c477`), ported to C++, Vulkan and Slang without changing its behaviour. The editor opens from a
**Particles** record in the Everest workspace: *Construct* (Ctrl+A) → *Solver · GPU Particles*, then the Inspector's
*Particle Editor* button. It fills the workspace as a modal window, and *Close Editor* returns to the scene.

| Part | Content |
|---|---|
| Outliner | Environment: the **Force Field** (master), **Wind** (its guest), the forces, **Lightning**; the effects |
| Viewport | The engine's image, HUD, probe, minimap, and the Force Field editor's visualization over the particles |
| Inspector | Force Field, Wind, force, Lightning and effect pages, in the Render settings look |
| Library | The same 52 presets in 14 groups, as a sheet with search and group chips |
| Log Stream | Engine start, presets added, forces added, strikes, overlay changes |

The field overlay is the Force Field editor's `ForceFieldVisualization` in its Camera projection, given a sampler of
the particle scene: Flow reads the GPU wind lattice back (trilinear), Accelerate evaluates `fieldAccel`, Damp
evaluates the taxonomy. The eos taxonomy's 12 force types (4 flows, 6 accelerations such as the attractor and the
repulsor, a drag volume and a current) are added from the Force Field page and drawn with their reach.

## Results

| Check | Program | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Library, packing, lightning, taxonomy against the prototype | `ParticleLibraryValidation` (ctest) | 🟢 343 of 343 |
| Slang port by the pinned slangc; stored archives | `StoreShaderArchives.py --verify` | 🟢 30 archives, 0 failures |
| The engine on Vulkan: 15 scenes | `ParticleSimulationCapture` | 🟢 15 of 15, 213 s |
| The editor in the workspace: 8 captures, open and close | `ParticleEditorCapture` | 🟢 8 of 8, 107 s |

`ParticleLibraryValidation` compares with `Results/PackingReference.toml`, written from the prototype's own modules by
`Code/ExportPackingReference.mjs`:

| Part | Agreement |
|---|---|
| Effect uniforms (`fillSys`), 52 presets | 3,008 of 3,008 exact |
| Light fibre uniforms | 640 of 640 exact |
| Light fibre paths | 7,150 of 7,168 exact; the rest within 2.2e-14 m |
| Refresh constants, wind components, acceleration fields, lensing | exact |
| Force taxonomy, 72 readings × 14 fields | worst error 0 |
| Lightning bolts | exact |

`ParticleEditorCapture` asserts:

- the record's editor opens through `InspectorRuntime`, the library decodes (52 presets), and the default scene holds 4
  effects and 4 fields;
- every capture has the engine's image with no failure. The opening capture has more than 500 particles alive and
  the wind lattice read back;
- `add-force:attract` adds the attractor, the library sheet opens, and `add:tornado` adds the preset and closes the
  sheet;
- closing (`CloseActiveEditor`, what *Close Editor* calls) clears the active editor; the workspace runs on.

`Capture` picks one image by name (`DefaultScene`, `EditorOpening` …); the editor capture still walks every step.

## Code

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `Code/ExportPackingReference.mjs` | The prototype's packing, taxonomy and lightning written as TOML |
| `Code/ParticleLibraryValidation.cpp` | The C++ port against that reference |
| `Code/ParticleSimulationCapture.cpp` | The engine alone: one scene per capture |
| `Code/ParticleEditorCapture.cpp` | The editor in the Everest workspace |
| `Code/ParticleSpaceValidation.cpp` | The `.particlespace` file, the level wind and the box volumes |

## ParticleSpace in the level (2026-11-04)

- **File:** a Particles record keeps its ParticleSpace in `<level>.<record>.particlespace` beside the level.
  - It is TOML in the preset library's own spelling, with the level key `space_file`.
  - The editor creates the file from the library's opening space the first time it opens the record.
  - The title shows the file and `UNSAVED`. Close and the level's Ctrl+S write it back.
  - The record's Inspector shows the space's figures; the six unused sliders are gone.
- **Level wind:** Wind page › Level. The level's Force Field (100 m to 100 km), sampled at an anchor in the level,
  joins the lattice as one more prevailing flow.
- **Box volumes:** the drag volume (type 4) and the current (type 5) now run in the field program. The prototype parity
  check covers eos's own entries and checks the box volumes separately.
- **Tornado funnels:** authored tornado ForceSource records raise condensation funnels in the GPU clouds.
- **Test:** `ParticleSpaceValidation`, 146/146 assertions:
  - 56 effects survive the round trip bit for bit, and 1680/1680 refresh uniforms are identical.
  - The level wind adds one flow only while it is followed.
  - Both box volumes are packed, and 6 malformed files are refused.
  - Ledger: `Results/ParticleSpaceValidation.txt`.

## Limits

- Captured offscreen on Linux with SwiftShader. The Windows build is cross-compiled and was not run on Windows.
- The level wind enters the lattice as one horizontal prevailing flow; the lattice's flows are horizontal.
- The prototype's thunder sound is not ported: the engine has no audio output yet.
